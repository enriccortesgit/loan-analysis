# Loan Default Prediction - Business Case

This repository contains a machine learning project. The objective is to build a supervised classification model to predict loan defaults for Lending Club, with a strong focus on minimizing financial risk and maximizing business impact.

Note: The dataset is too large to be hosted on GitHub.

## Business Insight Summary

Three strategies were evaluated based on model predictions:
- Conservative (Grades A & B): Lowest risk and most stable returns â€” Recommended
- Balanced (Grades B to D): High loss due to excessive defaults
- Aggressive (Grades D to F): High ROI but very high risk
